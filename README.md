This project showcases a simple application that get the weather information from specific locations which are input by the user.

For this we will be using async/await to handle the asynchronous calls to the API. The API is set to be public and pushed to Github intentionally,so there is no mistake in this part. This is part of the learning process from the curriculum so that Github can give us the warning.

Icons are added from the following Visual Crossing icons repository:
https://github.com/visualcrossing/WeatherIcons/tree/main#

Due to the subscription plan being a free tier,the time given from the API call may not be the exact time of the call because this plan doesn't support this feature.

The code will be divided in modules while at the same time using Webpack.

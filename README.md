This project showcases a simple application that get the weather information from specific locations which are input by the user.

For this we will be using async/await to handle the asynchronous calls to the API. The API is set to be public and pushed to Github intentionally,so there is no mistake in this part. This is part of the learning process from the curriculum so that Github can give us the warning.

The code will be divided in modules while at the same time using Webpack.
